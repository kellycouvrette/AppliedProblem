To run the GUI, run these commands: 

javac TrustGUI.java
java TrustGUI

This will bring you throught my test simulation (which I'll be explaining in my presentation). It will also automatically create the "experiment_results.csv" file with the outputted data. You can then run: 

python dataAnalysis.py

Which will automatically call in the csv created from the GUI.
